<p>This Cookie Statement explains how BigNeon, Inc. uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Sites or Applications ("Online Properties"), and any other webpages, subdomains, country level domain variants that link or refer to this Cookie Statement, and in course of using any of our Services. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. Any capitalized terms that are not also defined in this Cookie Statement are defined in our Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>What are cookies?<br/>
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
</p>
<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, BigNeon) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
    </p>
<p>Why do we use cookies?<br/>
BigNeon uses first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Online Properties to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our Users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Online Properties for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
</p>
<p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Online Properties and the purposes they perform are described under "Essential 1st party cookies" and "Analytics and customization cookies" below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific BigNeon Property you visit).
    </p>
<p>Essential 1st party cookies<br/>
These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with Services and to use some of the Site or Application, such as access to secure areas.
</p>
<p>Who serves these cookies: <br/>

• BigNeon.com and related top level domains.
    </p>
<p>How to refuse:
    </p>
<p>Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Online Properties to you, you cannot refuse them.
    </p>
<p>You may block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described below under the heading "How can I control cookies?", but you may not be able to use every Site or Application features, and in some cases the BigNeon Property simply will not perform.
    </p>
<p>Analytics and customization cookies<br/>
These cookies collect information that is used either in identifiable or aggregate form to help us understand how our Online Properties are being used, the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, or to help us customize our Online Properties for you.
</p>
<p>The following third parties use cookies on Online Properties: <br/>

• <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/">Facebook</a> <br/>
• <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners">Google Analytics & AMP Client ID </a>
</p>
<p>How to refuse:
    </p>
<p>To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading "<a href="#control-cookies">How can I control cookies?</a>"
    </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click on the link accompanying the third party cookie list above to learn more about how each third party uses cookies and to opt-out.
    </p>
<p>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?<br/>
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. Web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Online Properties or taken an action in relation to our Online Properties. We also facilitate our organizers ability to learn more about your interest in their event at their request through their use of these tracking pixels on our Online Properties. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly. As a result, declining cookies will impair their functioning.
</p>
<p>Does BigNeon allow for Social Networking Cookies?<br/>
Yes, these cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting, or events you might attend, through third party social networking and other websites. These cookies may be used for advertising purposes too by those social networks. The best way to refuse these cookies is to turn off the social options within your BigNeon account settings.
</p>
<p>What about Flash Cookies or Local Shared Objects?<br/>
Our Online Properties may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our Services, fraud prevention and for other Site or Application operations. If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
</p>
<p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Online Properties.
    </p>
<p>What about targeted advertising?<br/>
We do not offer you 3rd party advertising on Online Properties, however organizers selling tickets to events on Online Properties may use information about your visits to Online Properties and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services in which you may be interested. Organizers may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to Online Properties and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.
</p>
<p id="control-cookies">How can I control cookies?<br/>
You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above, or you can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.

As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
