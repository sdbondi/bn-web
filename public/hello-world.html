                    <h2> What is Big Neon?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Big Neon is a ticketing platform built to serve the unique needs of independent music promoters. It is open source, mobile-first and built in Rust.
                    </p>

                        <h2> What makes Big Neon different?</h2>

                            <p>
                                    We are drawing on our deep industry experience to design features that reimagine how ticketing works. Out of the gate, the Big Neon platform will support key features promoters have come to expect, such as best in class email, website and social tools. We’ve also streamlined how promoters set up events, define and sell from holds, and designed a beautiful mobile-first ticket buying experience. Initially, Big Neon will use a relational database (PosgreSQL). But central to our goal of changing the ticketing industry is for Big Neon to eventually issue tickets on the Tari blockchain. By issuing tickets on Tari, we hope to eliminate counterfeit tickets and enable promoters and venue owners to directly participate when their tickets are resold.

                    <p>
                            The Big Neon team has been at the cutting edge of technology and music promotion for decades. We’ve co-founded and led some of the most notable ticketing companies, including the largest exit in the global ticketing industry. We are proud of what we’ve accomplished in the past but even more excited for what comes next. When we started developing Big Neon, we met with dozens of leading promoters and venue owners. We heard how competitive the business has become and how existing platforms have become stagnant. A big problem we heard is that promoters and artists — the original economic participants in the sale of a ticket — don't benefit when their tickets are re-sold.  They deserve better.
